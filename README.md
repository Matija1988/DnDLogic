# DnDLogic
---------- WORK IN PROGRESS ----------
 
This is a pet project concept demonstator based upon pen and papper Dungens and Dragons, more accurately RPG classics like Baldurs Gate. 

This project is NOT meant to be a full game rather a demonstration of the following: 

1) OOP principles
   - Objects - Rangeing from simple to those with nested lists of objects
   - Inheritence - Interfaces and abstract classes, grouping object families via abstract super class (e.g. List<AbstAttribute> for Strenght, Dexterity ...)
   - Abstraction - Abstracting reusable code for e.g. user inputs, inheritence etc.
   - Polymorphism - Object behaviour change via inheritence
     
2) Patterns
   - This project demonstrates patterns like Factory method (weapon creation), Builder pattern (player character creation) ... State and Abstract factory, Strategy to follow
     
3) C# features
   - pattern matching
   - Func, Predicate and Action delegates
   - LINQ
   - Using Dictionaries as rule sets
   - Extension classes and methods
   - Partial and sealed classes


  Road map: 
 -(FINISHED) Character creation basic - a character can be created via hardcding
 -(IN PRGRESS) Character creation via user input 
 -(FINISHED) Basic combat system - basic hardcoded combat system works
 -(TO START) Interactive combat system - targeting, skill use, maybe magic use
 -(TO START) Inventory 
....
